# math

`math` defines a Starlark module of mathematical functions. All functions accept both int and float values as arguments. It's a official module provided in *Starlark in Go* repository.

## Constants

- `e`: The base of natural logarithms, approximately 2.71828.
- `pi`: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14159.

## Functions

### `acos(x)`

Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.

### `acosh(x)`

Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.

### `asin(x)`

Return the arc sine of x, in radians.

### `asinh(x)`

Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x.

### `atan(x)`

Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.

### `atan2(y, x)`

Return atan(y / x), in radians. The result is between -pi and pi. The vector in the plane from the origin to point (x, y) makes this angle with the positive X axis. The atan2() function can compute the correct quadrant for the angle since it knows the sign of both inputs. For example, atan(1) and atan2(1, 1) are both pi/4, but atan2(-1, -1) is -3*pi/4.

### `atanh(x)`

Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x.

### `ceil(x)`

Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

### `copysign(x,y)`

Returns a value with the magnitude of x and the sign of y.

### `cos(x)`

Return the cosine of x radians.

### `cosh(x)`

Return the hyperbolic cosine of x.

### `degrees(x)`

Convert angle x from radians to degrees.

### `exp(x)`

Returns e raised to the power x, where e = 2.718281â€¦ is the base of natural logarithms.

### `fabs(x)`

Return the absolute value of x.

### `floor(x)`

Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x.

#### Examples {id="floor-example"}

**basic**

calculate the floor of 2.9

```python
load("math", "floor")
x = floor(2.9)
print(x)
# Output: 2
```

### `gamma(x)`

Returns the Gamma function of x.

### `hypot(x, y)`

Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y). This is the length of the
vector from the origin to point (x, y).

### `log(x, base)`

Returns the logarithm of x in the given base, or natural logarithm by
default.

### `mod(x, y)`

Returns the floating-point remainder of x/y. The magnitude of the result is less than y and its sign agrees with that of x.

### `pow(x, y)`

Returns x**y, the base-x exponential of y.

#### Examples {id="pow-example"}

**basic**

raise 4 to the power of 3

```python
load("math", "pow")
x = pow(4,5)
print(x)
# Output: 1024.0
```

### `radians(x)`

Convert angle x from degrees to radians.

### `remainder(x, y)`

Returns the IEEE 754 floating-point remainder of x/y.

### `round(x)`

Returns the nearest integer, rounding half away from zero.

### `sqrt(x)`

Return the square root of x.

### `sin(x)`

Return the sine of x radians.

### `sinh(x)`

Return the hyperbolic sine of x.

### `tan(x)`

Return the tangent of x radians.

### `tanh(x)`

Return the hyperbolic tangent of x.
